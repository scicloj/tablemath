## What is this about?

This project is an initial attempt to create a Clojure library for math and statistics which is friendly to [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) and [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth) datasets and uses the functionality of [Fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath). 

In a way, it is intended to be a user-friendly compatiblity layer across this libraries.

Possibly, after the details clarify, it will be merged into one of the other Scicloj libraries.
